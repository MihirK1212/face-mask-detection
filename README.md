2) Ensure that a file named 'yolov3_training_last.weights' is now present in your project directory and it has a size of above 200mb

C] For Detection of a Single Image
1) Run the python script 'Detection_Image.py' and the image will load on your screen 
2) To try a different image, change the image file name in the python script  (Defualt image name is 'Test_Image (1).jpg' which is present in the repo) 

D] For Detection using a Web Cam
1) Run the python script 'Detection_Webcam.py' and your webcam will open
2) Please allow Python to access WebCam if asked so by your anti-virus software
